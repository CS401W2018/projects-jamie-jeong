        <h3>The title and topic of your site.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Title: Designed by Jihye</li>
            <li>Topic: Showcasing my graphic design project: a portfolio website</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h3>
        <p>I chose this topic because I am a graphic design major, and I wanted to go beyond just showing my work. Instead of using a simple portfolio, I wanted to take part in building the website itself. This project allows me to design not only the content but also the structure and user experience of my portfolio. Through this process, I can apply both my design and web development skills, making my portfolio more personal and interactive.</p>
        <h3>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Home Page</li>
            <p>It will include intro text, main visual, brief self introduction, and navigation menu.</p>
            <li>Portfolio Overview</li>
            <p>It will include a thumbnail gallery layout displaying all projects at a glance.</p>
            <li>Project Overview & Project Comparison</li>
            <p>It will have a table for project comparison</p>
            <li>Individual Project Detail page</li>
            <p>It will have a detailed description of each project.</p>
            <li>Feedback & Contact Form</li>
            <p>It will have a form for visitor feedback or design inquiries </p>
        </ol>
        <h3>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h3>
        <p>I will collect full name, email address, project inquiry/feedback, project type/interest, and preferred contact method through my form. In the table, there will be project name, type, tools used, and project link.</p>
        <h3>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h3>
        <p>To collect information, images, and content for my site, I will primarily use my own design projects and photos that I have created during my design courses. I will also incorporate relevant quotes from famous designers to inspire and add value to the content. For example, I plan to use quotes like "Design is not just about aesthetics, it's about solving problems" by Paul Rand (https://davidmiranda.us/blog/paul-rand-graphic-designer/), and "Design is the balance between function and beauty." by Massimo Vignelli (https://www.designculture.it/interview/massimo-vignelli.html). Additionally, I will refer to design articles and tutorials to explain the techniques and principles I used in my projects. I will include at least 5 references, including designer quotes and design resources.</p>
        <h3>Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.</h3>
        <p>I have read and understood the warnings.</p>
