        <h4>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h4>
        <p>Block tags take up the full width of a line, and always start on a new line. They have height and width. Inline tags surround text, only take up as much space as needed, and stay on the same line.</p>
        <h4>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h4>
        <p>Margin is space outside the box, it moves the entire box away from other elements. Border is the edge of the box, it adds a visible line around the element. Padding is space inside the box, and the content moves inward, creates space inside the border. </p>
        <h4>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h4>
        <p>For borders, we can use px, thin, in, cm and they are fixed-size measurement. As relative measurement, we have % and em. Em unit is a relative measurement based on the font size of its parent element. </p>
        <h4>When would you use a figure tag?</h4>
        <p>A figure tag can be used for images with captions, grouping images. It is often used with the FIGCAPTION tag to provide a caption for the content inside.  </p>
