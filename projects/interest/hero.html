        <p>My hero is A.J. Cook, the actress who plays Jennifer Jareau on Criminal Minds. She is my hero because the show shows her character growing from a public relations representative to a field agent for the FBI, and in doing so, she shows a strong sense of responsibility and excellent negotiation skills. In addition, she actually overcame her significant vision problems to succeed as an actress, and her character developed over the course of the long season due to her persistence. This has been a great inspiration to me, which is why she is my role model and hero. <br>Her representative works and roles are as follows.</p>
