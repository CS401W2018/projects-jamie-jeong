        <p><span class="bold">Criminal Minds</span> is my favorite show of all time. It follows the work of the FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit Team, a team that specializes in profiling. It's interesting to note that one of the producers worked as a police officer for over a decade, and the show is written with the help of real profilers, which gives it a realistic feel.</p>
        <p>I like this show the most because it's not just about tracking down and catching criminals, it's about analyzing the criminal's psychology and how each member of the team works together to solve the case despite their different characteristics. I also enjoy the inclusion of human quotes in every episode. 
            It's not only entertaining, but also thought-provoking.</p>

        <li>I chose my colors based on readability and contrast. I used Paletton to find a balanced color scheme and make sure the emphasized and de-emphasized text stand out properly.</li>
