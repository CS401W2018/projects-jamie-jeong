    <h1>&quot;Annyeong, my name is Jihye Jeong&quot;</h1>
<p>I'm a <em>graphic design</em> student from <strong>Korea</strong>. I'm studying this because I love to do this, and I also believe that design changes our lives well. As a graphic design student, I have done some projects in classes. Today, I would like to introduce some of them briefly.</p>
<p>So far, the classes I've taken are drawing&amp;design principles, three-dimensional concepts, digital design, digital photography, branding, and typography. Below are three of my favorite projects from those classes.</p>
<ol type="A">
    <li><mark>Branding</mark>
        <ul>
            <li>Trademark</li>
            <li>Brand Identity System</li>
            <li>Style Guide</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><mark>Typography</mark>
        <ul>
            <li>Type Poster Project</li>
        </ul>
    <li><mark>Design</mark></li>
<ul>
    <li>Animal Icon</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to end by leaving a famous quote.</p>
<blockquote>"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."</blockquote>
